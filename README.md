# Simple Banking System

A simple banking system made by using Javascript to showcase its multi-paradigm 
features.

# Tools Used

2. HTML, CSS and Javascript.
# Explaination
1. Procedural Paradigm:
**logBalance(balance)** is a simple procedural function that logs the current balance.

2. Object-Oriented Paradigm:
**BankAccount** is a class that encapsulates data (owner, balance) and provides methods for manipulating that data (**deposit**, **withdraw**, **getBalance**).

3. Functional Paradigm:
**applyFees** is a pure function that takes the current balance and a fee, then returns the new balance after applying the fee without mutating the original balance.
